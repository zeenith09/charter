Group Charter: Your Team Name
Meetings: List time
Group Contacts:

Goals:
1. To adhere well as a group, respecting each member, and supporting each member by
working together to accomplish the goals listed below and adhering to this charter.
2. To gain a more intimate knowledge of the software life cycle by working as a group to
develop a quality product worth an “A”.
3. To attain practical knowledge and experience of what it means to be a software engineer
and to familiarize ourselves with the methods and practices that are required to pull
together a team project.

Work Norms:
1. Time commitment required by each group member:
  Each member should expect to spend at least one hour per day working on the project. Within that hour, group members should look over
  commits and stay up to date with changes happening in the project. The work necessary for a particular sprint may require more than 
  one hour per day, which is ok. Each group member is free to decide when they want to/ are able to work on the project so long as the 
  necessary deadlines are being met. 

2. Dealing with different work habits:
  Group members can complete work whenever they like so long as their working habits do not interfere with the productivity of others.
  If your work habits are found to be inconsistent with those of the rest of the group, then some changes to work habits may be necessary 
  so that work is completed in a timely manner.

Ground Rules:
  Meetings:
    1. Length of meetings:
    Meetings may have to take as long as it takes, however meetings longer than 1 ½ hours
    are discouraged. The purpose of meetings is to establish communication and give
    direction to the project. Meetings once a week should be enough unless it is decided by
    the group that additional meetings should be scheduled. This communication should take
    place through the group email. It is understood that if a meeting takes too long, members
    may have to leave for classes or work obligations. This type of situation will not
    constitute and offense.
    2. Missing a meeting:
    An occasional missing of a meeting can be accepted. If however an individual repeatedly
    misses a meeting without good cause, some disciplinary action may have to be taken.
    Acceptable justification of a missed meeting includes, but is not limited to: injury, illness,
    family emergency, work, conflicting class schedule, or death (yourself or other). If a
    meeting is missed for any other reason, the affected group members will decide as to
    whether the reason for missing the meeting is acceptable or in need of disciplinary action.
    Two meetings missed without emailed valid excuse will result in a minor offence. Three
    will result in a major offence.
    3. Tardiness to meetings:
    A person being obviously late for a meeting and not fitting the structure of „on time‟ shall
    be given over to disciplinary action as described in minor offence. On time means the
    time the meeting is scheduled to start (3:30pm on Mondays). If an individual arrives at a
    meeting after the start time and the meeting has yet to get into purposeful conversation
    then it may be overlooked. However if there is no good excuse for being late and the
    meeting is clearly underway when the individual arrives then at the end of the meeting it
    will be discussed as to whether disciplinary action will have to be taken. Being late to a
    meeting more than once constitutes a minor offence. Records of being late will be
    recorded by group note taker.
    4. Phone use during meetings:
    As we only have an hour each week to meet, it should not be too much to ask that outside
    phone calls should be prohibited unless they are perceived to be an emergency. The
    taking of phone calls will come into question if they are taken often during meetings and
    the offender will be politely asked to discontinue. If the behavior continues, it will be
    discussed among the group as to whether it should be a minor offense. Checking a text
    message will be allowed as well as sending an occasional text to let someone know you
    are in a meeting and will get back to them. However social texting will not be allowed
    and the offender will again be politely asked to stop. If the behavior continues it will be
    discussed among the group as to whether it should be a minor offence.
    5. Food and drink during meetings:
    There is no limit to what food can be consumed during meetings as long as the facility we
    are meeting in allows it and people clean up after themselves. If an individual‟s food
    consumption is disruptive during a meeting, they will be politely asked to be less
    disruptive. If it continues, their food may be confiscated. They will have a new chance at
    the next meeting. If disruptive eating continues week after week, food may be banned at
    meetings via a majority decision by the group. If a member does not clean up after
    themselves there will be a warning. After the first warning it will constitute a minor
    offense.

Group communication and interaction:
  1. Regular communication:
    Regular communication should occur every two days via email. This communication
    should include a simple update on ones progress of their portion of the project. When a
    member finishes their portion of the project, they should attach their finished product in
    an email to all group members. If it cannot be attached to the email, the member shall
    explain a way to view the finished product. If a member forgets to post progress, any
    member can send an inquiry email to the person who forgot. If the email is not responded
    to in 24 hours, the group will begin to take on that member‟s responsibilities through the
    decision making process stated in part six of this section. If the member has a good
    reason for not responding, it will be taken into consideration as to whether there will be
    disciplinary action; otherwise it will be an immediate minor offense. If however, the
    member responds within the 24 hour time period stating they forgot, no disciplinary
    action will be taken. If a member is having problems with their portion of the work, they
    should let the rest of the group knew immediately so they can received any needed help
    as soon as possible.
  2. Group communication on tardiness/missed meetings and meeting information:
    If a member has prior knowledge of a missed meeting or tardiness of a day or more, that
    member shall send an email to all group members signifying such. If it is the day of the
    meeting and a group member is going to miss the meeting or knows they are going to be
    tardy by more than five minutes, that member shall send a text message to all group
    members informing them of the situation. Failure to do so more than once will result in a
    minor offense.
  3. Communication ethics:
    There shall be an understanding among group members that all opinions or input by any
    individual member is valued and will be respected, even if disagreed with. People and/or
    their opinions shall not in any way be degraded or dismissed but all opinions shall have
    equal consideration. If a member feels his opinions are being rejected without good
    reason, he has a right to bring it up to the group leader and/or the group. The group will
    then discuss the situation and either reconsider their opinions, or make a case as to why
    the members opinions are not being used. If there is such a disagreement, the note taker
    or agenda maker will record the situation as well as the member who feels disregarded. If
    this situation happens more than three times the member has a right to go to the TA and
    state their case. If the problem is not solved by the TA, the opportunity is then open to
    state their case to Rock.
  4. Group structure:
    The group shall have the following roles to help the group be more efficient:
    Yoda – This role belongs to the group leader. This jedi master is responsible for the flow
    of the meeting and has a helpful role in the delegation of responsibilities.
    R2-D2 – This role belongs to the meeting note taker. This droid is responsible to take
    notes at all the meetings and to relay the important information and any decisions made
    during the meeting to the other members via email by the end of the next day. They will
    also be responsible for recording any disciplinary actions taken toward any member of
    the group.
    Han Solo – This role belongs to the agenda maker. This member of the rebellion is
    responsible for making an agenda of subjects which need to be covered in the upcoming
    meeting. The agenda shall be emailed to the group before Saturday for a Monday meeting
    and three days before any other meeting.
    If any member in a role does not follow through with his responsibilities on multiple
    occasions or if for some reason a member is not able to perform their duties, they shall be
    replaced by group decision.
  5. Decision making:
    Any decisions which need to be made about the project, project direction or disciplinary
    action will be made by a majority vote. Any decisions about delegation will be covered in
    part six.
  6. Group decisions on delegation:
    The delegation of responsibilities to group members will be decided in the following
    fashion. The responsibilities will be discussed and decided on as a group decision. Then
    each group member has the opportunity to volunteer for the task he may want. If a group
    member does not volunteer for a task, they will be assigned one by Yoda. If a group
    member feels the portion of responsibility is unfair, they may voice their concern and
    state a reason why. If a majority of the group feels this member is correct, the
    responsibilities will be reformed and the delegation process will start again.

Group participation and work quality

1. Group participation:
If a group member isn't participating or is over participating it will be any team member's responsibility 
to politely ask the member to share either more or less based on the situation so there would be a balanced
amount of opportunity for the project. If some is asked to share what they think or is asked to give others a chance to
share, but they do not, and their under or over sharing is blocking the flow of the meeting,
then by group decision it may be considered a minor offense.

2. Work not up to standard:
Group standards, regarding quality and timeliness of work, is a crucial key to the group's success; therefore, 
we should always be putting forth the effort necessary to submit our best work. However, if there is a problem
it should be handled in the following manner. If it is the first time someone may not be able to put in the time
or effort necessary to meet group standards due to understanable external reasons, the member must communicate with
the group as soon as possible so the task can be redistributed. If they continus to repeat this behavior
it may result in a minor or major offence depending on the severity.
In any case two minor offence must be given to the individual, for this action, before a major offence is given. At
some point the group may seize to offer work to him as he is untrustworthy at that point. If too many major offence is
given, communication with TA or the professor is needed.
However, a group member may be able to redeem themself. If said member continues to perform above expectations for at least 
two weeks (time depends on how many minor/major offense they commited), the past offenses may be forgiven.

3. Group members unprepared:
It is understood that people are busy with other classes and school work; however, if by group
consciousness it is obvious that a member is unprepared for a meeting, and their
unpreparedness is negatively affecting the group and project, then disciplinary action will
have to take place. Unpreparedness of this form will immediately result in a warning then
a minor offence hereafter.

4. Workload too heavy:
If with the time restraints and number of group members actively participating is not
sufficient enough to complete the task, a plea of mercy will be sent to the Rock via email
and in person which logs the details of the amount of work to be done, the status of how
far we are, and why we can‟t complete it in that time period.

Disciplinary Procedures:

1. Regarding disciplinary actions:
Any disciplinary action to be administered can be overridden by group conscience, if
decided by a majority vote.

2. Disciplinary Log:
The note taker will be responsible for logging any information on offenses committed by
any member. This information will be included with the meeting notes every week so each
member knows where they stand.

3. Minor Group Offence:
A minor group offence can occur for breaking indicated statutes of the charter. A record 
of the minor offence will be recorded by the group assigned note taker. If the minor offence
is corrected immediately, it will be stricken from the record.

4. Major Group Offence:
A major group offence can occur by breaking indicated statutes of the charter, or for
accumulation of 3 or more minor offences. A group member who has committed a major offence
is on probation, and his probation status is to be clearly documented by email including a 
detailed description of his offence. The offender may return to regular group member status 
upon a group consensus. If the offender commits another offence constituted as either minor 
or major, he will become a candidate for punishment and dismissal.

5. Punishment and Dismissal:
A group member committing enough minor and major offences will be considered for punishment 
up to and including dismissal, and will be given over to review by the TA and Professor Rock.
An email describing the offences leading up to punishment and potential dismissal will be
displayed along with testimonies from at least 2 other group members and a log of
offenses. If available, the offending member's work will be confiscated and termed as
“belonging to the group”.
